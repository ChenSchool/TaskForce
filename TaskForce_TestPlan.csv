HOW TO RUN THE TEST CASES - INSTRUCTIONS,,,,,,,,,
========================================,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
Section,Instruction Details,,,,,,,,
Prerequisites - Software,"1. Node.js (v14 or higher) installed
2. npm or yarn package manager
3. MySQL database server running
4. Git for version control
5. VS Code or terminal access",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
Prerequisites - Database Setup,"1. Ensure MySQL server is running
2. Create test database (if separate from dev)
3. Run database migrations/schema setup
4. Ensure database connection settings in .env or config files are correct
5. Test database should have proper permissions",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
Prerequisites - Environment Setup,"1. Navigate to TaskforceAPI directory: cd TaskforceAPI
2. Install dependencies: npm install
3. Verify .env file has correct database credentials
4. Ensure test user accounts exist in database (admin, supervisor, guest)
5. Check that all required environment variables are set",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
Running All Tests,"1. Open terminal in TaskforceAPI directory
2. Run command: npm test
3. Jest will execute all test files in /tests directory
4. View summary showing passed/failed tests and coverage
5. Review any errors in terminal output",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
Running Specific Test File,"1. Open terminal in TaskforceAPI directory
2. Run command: npm test <filename>
   Examples:
   - npm test aircraft.test.ts
   - npm test tasks.test.ts
   - npm test personnel.test.ts
3. View results for only that test file",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
Running Specific Test Suite,"1. Use Jest's --testNamePattern flag
2. Command: npm test -- --testNamePattern=""<suite name>""
   Example: npm test -- --testNamePattern=""GET /aircraft""
3. Runs only tests matching the pattern",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
Running With Coverage Report,"1. Open terminal in TaskforceAPI directory
2. Run command: npm test -- --coverage
3. View coverage summary in terminal
4. Open detailed HTML report: TaskforceAPI/coverage/index.html
5. Review line, branch, function, and statement coverage",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
Running in Watch Mode,"1. Open terminal in TaskforceAPI directory
2. Run command: npm test -- --watch
3. Tests auto-run when files change
4. Press 'a' to run all tests
5. Press 'q' to quit watch mode",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
Viewing Test Results,"1. Terminal output shows:
   - Green checkmarks (✓) for passing tests
   - Red X marks (✗) for failing tests
   - Test execution time
   - Number of passed/failed/total tests
2. Failed tests show error details and stack traces
3. Coverage percentages displayed for each category",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
Debugging Failed Tests,"1. Review error message and stack trace in terminal
2. Check Expected vs Actual values in assertion failures
3. Verify database has required test data
4. Ensure authentication tokens are valid
5. Check API endpoints are running (may need to start server)
6. Add console.log() statements in test file if needed
7. Run single test: npm test -- -t ""test name""",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
Interpreting Test Results,"1. PASS = Test executed successfully, assertion passed
2. FAIL = Test failed, assertion did not match expected result
3. Check status codes match expected (200, 201, 400, 401, 404)
4. Verify response data structure matches expectations
5. Review timing for performance tests (should meet thresholds)",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
Filling Out Excel Status Column,"1. Run test file: npm test <filename>
2. For each test case that executes:
   - If passes: Enter ""Pass"" in Status column
   - If fails: Enter ""Fail"" in Status column
   - If skipped: Enter ""Not Run"" in Status column
3. Copy actual response/behavior to Actual Result column
4. Add any observations to Notes column",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
Performance Test Considerations,"1. Performance tests have timing assertions
2. First run may be slower (database warm-up)
3. Run performance tests multiple times for consistency
4. Ensure no other heavy processes running during test
5. Document system specs in Notes if timing fails
6. Thresholds: Dashboard < 3s, GET requests < 1s, Archive < 10s",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
Troubleshooting Common Issues,"1. Connection Refused: Check database is running and credentials correct
2. 401 Unauthorized: Verify test users exist in database
3. Tests timeout: Increase Jest timeout or check database performance
4. Module not found: Run npm install to install dependencies
5. Port already in use: Stop other instances of API server
6. Database errors: Check schema is up to date and tables exist",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
Test Execution Order,"1. Tests run in parallel by default for speed
2. Each test file is independent and self-contained
3. beforeAll() hooks set up test data
4. afterAll() hooks clean up test data
5. Tests should not depend on execution order
6. Run sequentially if needed: npm test -- --runInBand",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
CI/CD Integration,"1. Tests can run in GitHub Actions or other CI systems
2. Command in CI: npm test -- --coverage --ci
3. CI flag prevents watch mode and optimizes output
4. Coverage reports can be uploaded to code coverage services
5. Set test environment variables in CI configuration",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
Best Practices,"1. Run all tests before committing code
2. Maintain test coverage above 60%
3. Fix failing tests immediately
4. Update test cases when features change
5. Add new tests for new features
6. Review coverage report to identify untested code
7. Keep test data isolated and clean up after tests",,,,,,,,
